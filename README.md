# Flask Web Application Examples

This GitHub repository provides a collection of Flask web application examples that demonstrate various machine learning and natural language processing tasks, including object detection, pose detection, a BERT-based chatbot, and speech-to-text/text-to-speech functionality. These applications serve as practical demonstrations of how to integrate these capabilities into web applications using Flask, a popular Python web framework.

## Introduction

Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework that makes it easy to build web applications. This repository showcases how to create web applications that leverage machine learning models for various tasks. The examples provided here are intended to serve as a starting point for developers interested in building web applications with these capabilities.

## Examples

### Object Detection

The Object Detection example demonstrates how to build a web application that can detect objects in uploaded images using a pre-trained deep learning model. Users can upload an image, and the application will identify and annotate objects within the image.

### Pose Detection

The Pose Detection example shows how to create a web application that can estimate human poses from images or live camera feeds. This application can be used for applications like yoga pose analysis or fitness tracking.

### BERT Chatbot

The BERT Chatbot example illustrates how to integrate a BERT-based chatbot into a web application. Users can interact with the chatbot by typing messages, and the chatbot will provide responses based on the context of the conversation.

### Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech

The Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech example demonstrates how to build a web application that can convert spoken language into text and vice versa. Users can record audio or input text, and the application will perform the respective conversion.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the examples, follow the instructions provided in each example's respective directory. You may need to install dependencies, download pre-trained models, and configure the Flask application.

## Usage

Each example in this repository includes usage instructions specific to that example. Refer to the README files in the respective example directories for details on how to run and use the application.
